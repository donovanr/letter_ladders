# Take a letter, leave a word

I often stare at signs and look for interesting words to play with.  One thing I do is try to remove letters from a word to see if it makes another word.  It's extra pleasing when you can keep removing letters and still keep making words.  For instance,

`strings -> string -> sting -> sing -> in -> i`

is a good one, since you can get all the way to a one letter word, which is a kind of word-nerd victory.

The puzzle/question is this: what is the longest word you can do this to?

If you feel like cheating, the code in this repository is one answer.  Can you do it more efficiently?
